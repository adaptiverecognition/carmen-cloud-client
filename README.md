# Carmen Cloud Client
The Carmen Cloud Client provides a convenient way to leverage the features of the Adaptive Recognition's Carmen Cloud platform. With the Carmen Cloud platform, you can extract the needed information from the uploaded images, such as license plate numbers, vehicle make and model, and vehicle identification numbers (VINs). 

# Building the client
Before proceeding, install a [JDK](https://jdk.java.net/archive/) (must be Java 17 or later) and [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/install.html).

Ensure `JAVA_HOME` is set correctly and the `mvn` executable is available on your PATH.

Run the following command in a terminal/console.
```bash
mvn clean install
```

This compiles the client into your local maven repository.
